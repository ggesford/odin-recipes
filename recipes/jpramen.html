        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p> Ramen is a beloved Japanese noodle soup that offers a perfect blend of flavors and textures. At its core, ramen features rich, savory broth made from simmered meats, seafood, or vegetables, infused with seasonings like soy sauce, miso, or salt. The dish is typically served with chewy wheat noodles, which soak up the delicious broth.</p>
        <p>Toppings play a crucial role in elevating the dish, with popular choices including tender slices of chashu pork, soft-boiled eggs, fresh green onions, and crunchy nori. Each bowl can be customized to suit individual tastes, making ramen a versatile and comforting meal. Whether enjoyed at a bustling ramen shop or made at home, this iconic dish brings warmth and satisfaction with every slurp. Perfect for both casual meals and gourmet experiences, ramen is truly a global favorite!</p>
        <p>This recipe in particular is going to be for Shoyu Ramen! Shoyu is Japanese for soy sauce and will be the main flavor provider in this recipe. We are also going to be using a pressure cooker to help extract all the flavor into the broth quicker.</p>

            <li>3 quarts water</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Tare sauce:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>1/2 cup mirin</li>

            <li>1/4 cup white sugar</li>
            <li>8 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>4 inches dashi kombu</li>
            <li>3 ounces packaged cooked ramen noodles, or to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chicken, scallops, anchovies, shrimp, bonito flakes, half the ginger, and kombu in an electric pressure cooker. Add water; close and lock the lid. Select the Soup setting; set timer for 90 minutes according to manufacturer's instructions. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.</li>
            <li>Release pressure using the natural-release method according to manufacturer's instructions, 10 to 40 minutes. Strain broth through a colander or fine-mesh sieve. Skim the fatty oil off the top of the broth.</li>
            <li>Combine soy sauce, mirin, sake, green onions, bonito flakes, sugar, garlic, and kombu in a medium saucepan over high heat. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer until flavors blend, about 10 minutes. Strain tare sauce through a fine-mesh sieve into a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour 2 tablespoons of tare sauce into a large bowl. Ladle in about 2 cups of broth. Add 1/6 of the ramen noodles. Repeat with remaining tare, broth, and ramen.</li>
            <li>Add any toppings that you like, such as chashu (see my recipe), menma, corn, toasted seaweed or soft boiled egg. Garnish with green onions.</li>
        </ol>
