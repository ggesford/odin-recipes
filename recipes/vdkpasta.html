        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Vodka Sauce is a delectable Italian-American creation that marries the richness of cream with the vibrant flavors of tomatoes and a splash of vodka. This luscious sauce begins with saut√©ed garlic and onions, which are then combined with crushed tomatoes, creating a flavorful base. The addition of vodka not only enhances the sauce's depth but also helps to dissolve the acidity of the tomatoes, resulting in a smooth and balanced flavor profile.</p>
        <p>Cream is stirred in to add a velvety texture, making the sauce perfect for coating pasta. Often garnished with fresh basil and a sprinkle of Parmesan cheese, Vodka Sauce pairs beautifully with penne, rigatoni, or even as a base for baked dishes. Quick to prepare and utterly indulgent, this sauce is a favorite for weeknight dinners and special occasions alike, offering a taste of Italian comfort in every bite!</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 tablespoons minced garlic</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vodka</li>
            <li>1 pint heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>28 oz tomato sauce</li>
            <li>16 oz crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>1/2 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat a large saucepan over high heat until the surface is very hot; add minced garlic and sear until brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour vodka into the saucepan, taking care in case any flames ignite from the alcohol meeting the hot surface of the pan. Quickly pour cream into pan to douse any flames and stir; add tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, Parmesan cheese, basil, and parsley.</li>
            <li>Bring the mixture to a boil, remove from heat, and rest sauce long enough to let herbs flavor the sauce, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
