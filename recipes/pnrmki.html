            <li>1/2 teaspoon red chilli powder</li>
            <li>1-2 green chillies</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon garam masala</li>
            <li>1/2-1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>1/2-1 inch ginger, julienned</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek leaves</li>
            <li>1.5 cups water</li>
            <li>salt, as required</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <h3>Making Tomato Puree</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First rinse and chop the tomatoes. Use the tomatoes that are ripe with a sweet tangy taste and not overly sour.</li>
            <li>In a blender or grinder make a smooth puree of the chopped tomatoes. No need to add any water while blending the tomatoes.</li>
            <li>Keep the tomato puree aside.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Making paneer makhani</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt butter in a pan. First add the tej patta (Indian bay leaf) and saute for a few seconds till aromatic.</li>
            <li>Then add the crushed ginger-garlic paste and saute for a few seconds or till the raw aroma of the ginger-garlic goes away.</li>
            <li>Add the tomato puree and stir well.</li>
            <li>Now add the red chili powder and saute this mixture till the fat begins to leave the side of the tomato paste. Takes about 14 to 15 on a low heat. Keep on stirring often.</li>
            <li>When you see the tomato mixture clumping together and the fat leaving the sides, then add water.</li>
            <li>Stir and simmer till the gravy or sauce thickens a bit. Takes about 7 to 8 minutes on a low flame.</li>
            <li>Then add the slit green chilies and ginger julienne. Stir and simmer for a minute.</li>
            <li>Add sugar, salt as required and crushed kasuri methi (dry fenugreek leaves).</li>
            <li>Stir and then add the paneer cubes.</li>
            <li>Mix gently and switch off the heat. No need to cook the paneer as then they can get hard or chewy and won't taste good.</li>
            <li>Lastly add cream and gently stir. Switch off the flame and then sprinkle with garam masala. Give a gentle stir again.</li>
            <li>Serve the paneer makhani with roti, naan, paratha or jeera rice or saffron rice or biryani rice or plain steamed basmati rice.</li>
